# About

This library aims to be the simplest, easiest to use (and debug) functional programming library. No complex return types, no weird, overloaded base classes. No classes at all actually!

We depend greatly on Python's standard library, especially partial, to give the feeling of currying while not sacrificing performance, or generating (hopefully) too much complexity. The approach taken is to just wrap the imperative approach so that code can be more composable.

Type parameters are used where reasonable, though you're on your own if you're using dictionaries...

Inspired by the Ramda.js library.
